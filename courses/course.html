                            <p>Ethical Hacking sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages.  The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing.Ethical hackers are expected to report all the vulnerabilities and weakness found during the process to the management.</p>

                            <p>A penetration test, or pen test, is an attempt to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may exist in operating systems, services and application flaws, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior. Such assessments are also useful in validating the efficacy of defensive mechanisms, as well as end-user adherence to security policies.Penetration testing is typically performed using manual or automated technologies to systematically compromise servers.</p>

As a result, this leads to tremendous time savings. Besides, constant availability removes barriers to access to information for students who are physically unable to attend classes in person.</p>
